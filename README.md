# SoftFormanceTask2

A bank has implemented criteria for determining whether the transaction passwords typed by customers of the bank are valid or not.
                        
The following are the criteria for checking the transaction password:
                        
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [*#+@]
5. Minimum length of transaction password: 4
6. Maximum length of transaction password: 6
7. No space is allowed
                        
Write a program that will accept a sequence of comma-separated transaction passwords and will check them according to the bank's criteria. Passwords that match the criteria
are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
                        
Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

Abc@1,a B1#,2w3E*,2We#3345

Then, the output of the program should be:

Abc@1,2w3E*

Note: You should assume that input to the program is from console input (raw_input)
